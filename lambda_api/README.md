# luxwastecalendar/lambda_api
This is the source code of a basic AWS Lambda service. It leverages the output of luxwastecalendar/web_crawler.
All json files generated by luxwastecalendar/web_crawler must be copied into a repo/ folder along this lambda function.

The lambda function must be exposed via the AWS API Manager with appropriate settings. Our live API can be used freely for your own projects. Simply contact us via https://synapz.lu to get a free API KEY
