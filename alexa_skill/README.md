## Alexa Skill "Calendrier des collectes"

This source code might not fully reflect the skill currently deployed in production because git repos cannot be used for versioning in Alexa developper console. This skill is designed to work with the API exposed using luxwastercalendar/lambda_api code.

On top of the nodejs source code shared in this repo, the skill must be defined by its interaction model which is a combination of intents, utterance, voice examples etc. The interaction model is not easily sharable in github, but don't hesitate to contact us for more details : https://synapz.lu
